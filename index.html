					Session Date: 3/04/2015 (Week 1)
                 1) Added global tags to index.html
                 2) Added the following text tags to index.html:  <italic <i>, bold <b>, strong <strong>.
                 3) Added the following images to index.html:  <smileyFace.jpg, .
                 4) Named page index.html with title of page Cassan_Donna_MIS577_64255.
					Session Date: 3/8/2015 (Week 2)
                 5) Included a table, with two images of a clock, displaying the business hours.
                 6) Included a registration page (registration.html) with an image <aprogrammerslife.jpg>.
                 7) Added a hyper-link to the index.html page which directs you to the registration page. 
                    Once this form is submitted you are redirected to the Code Library page.
                 8) Integrated CSS within the site
					Session Date: 3/15/2015 (Week 3)
				 9) Included 4 HTML features
				    a) Added a Contact Us page with an image called "web-design-proposal,jpg" 
					   Included a form using the <fieldset> tag. Included a nested form within 
					   the first form with an "Email Us" option.
					b) Updated the registration page by using the <fieldset> tag.
					c) Added several <div> tags to each page for .css formatting.
					d) Added a .swf file called "480_myanaclock1.swf" to the top right of each page. 
					   This file displays a clock with the time and the date and was downloaded from...
					   https://f1.creativecow.net/480/analogstyle-flash-clock
					e) Added links the left side of each page leading to home, registration, contact us, or the code library.
				10) Included a script with a function called 'myFunction()' that allows a user to enter their preferred 
					web-design language from a prompt and then displays an explanation of that language.					
					Session Date: 3/22/2015(Week 4)
				11) Altered the way 'myFunction' works. Instead of a prompt the user chooses their preferred
					web-design language from a drop-down list.
				13) I added a page called discount.html where the user can play a crap game and if they win they get a discount.
					The script for the crap game was found at Fig. 9.7 in our book.(Deitel, 08/2012, p. 297)
					There is a function called startGame() that has a 'do while' loop that only allows the user to play the crap game once a day.
					Session Date: 3/29/2015(Week 5)
				14) I added a script with a function called validateForm() on the registration.html page. this function
					ensures that the user fills out all of the fields and that the passwords match.
				15) I included a cookie on the index.html page that asks for the users name and then includes that
					name in the welcome message.
				16) I included a date function on the discount.html page to display when the user could try playing
					the craps game again.
