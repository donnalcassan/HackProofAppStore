Hi,

I am taking a web development class for my Masters degree in Computer Information Systems Managagement. I am required to create a website in this class and this is what I have so far. I know it is not perfect but in order to learn you must do. I would love to obtain an entry level position in programming websites or anything. The only way I am going to become proficient in any language is to code on a full time basis. I have taken Visual Basic, Java, C#, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. I love it and would like to excel in a programming career.
